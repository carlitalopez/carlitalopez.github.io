        <h1> About me!!!</h1>
            <p>Hi!!! My name is Carla Lopez and I'm from Chiclayo, a city from a South American country called Peru. (Arriba Peru,señores y señoras!!) 
            I graduated from Champagnat High School back in December of 2021. I like spending my free time playing and watching soccer. My favorite team is FC Barcelona
            so if you're a Real Madrid fan please stay away from me.(joke) Moreover, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and doing outdoor activites such as hiking</p>
